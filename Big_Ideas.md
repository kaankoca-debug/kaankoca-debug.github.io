## [Scratch Tic Tac Toe:]()

**Collaboration:**
I made this project individually, with no collaboration. Even though collaboration presents a diversity of perspectives, the project helped me to focus on developing my skills of coding. With individual work, I felt confident of delivering a complete game from a blank page. But I also felt a little stressed because I didn’t have any coding background.

**Program Function and Purpose:**
The program is a simple game of tic-tac-toe with O’s and X’s. Two sides mark spaces, and with a win, the background changes to a winning page. It aims to allow individuals to enjoy a simple and old game through my program.

**Program Design and Development:**
I started with nine rectangles for the grid and made my own X’s and O’s with a backdrop of Scratch. As it was my first real code project, I tested the program over and over again after every change I made. Over time, I created the layout and made sure the program was working smoothly.

**Identifying and Correcting Errors:**
As I refined the program, I also encountered issues with the background failing to shift correctly and sometimes the X appearing during O's input. With testing over and over again, I corrected both of these problems of logic and improved the use of the program.

## [Swift Tic Tac Toe:]()

**Collaboration:**
I completed this project individually with no collaboration. Collaboration has lots of points of views and ideas, but individually this project developed my skills of work and making oneself familiar with Swift coding. It helped me to focus on learning how I should organize visual output of a program.

**Program Function and Purpose:**
The program's job is simply to print out a simple tic-tac-toe board. It draws nine squares with some of them filled with Os and Xs, but it can't actually be played or used. Its purpose is purely visual.

**Program Design and Development:**
I created the board with code defining nine squares of a grid. Then I added a few X’s and O’s to show possible moves. With no gameplay or logic involved, the creation involved mostly positioning and looks. It went smoothly and confirmed my knowledge with Swift.

**Identifying and Correcting Errors:**
I didn't make any mistakes while creating this program. It wasn't hard to get correct the first time because I only needed to do some plotting on the grid and positioning the symbols. But I still checked that the X’s and O’s were where I wanted them to be.

## [Swift Favorites:]()

**Collaboration:**
I also worked independently and did not collaborate with anyone. By working independently, I could concentrate on my ideas. I don’t think this program was hard. It took less than 5 minutes and it was just practice for my Swift coding. 

**Program Function and Purpose:**
The program just shows the texts I wrote to the code. So it is the very basics of Swift actually. I put 3 sentence starters and put my favorite emoji, number and color. So its function is to show to the screen what I wrote. 

**Program Design and Development:**
I created the program through typing out my sentences and putting my favorite number, color and emoji. I purposely went about making the writing legible. The process was  very easy and clear. I liked watching the program run correctly. 

**Identifying and Correcting Errors:**
This was a program that is about the basics of Swift Playground. So I didn’t encounter any problems because it was really easy to code. There was a text written by me and being printed onto the screen.

## [Swift Ice Cream Shop:]()

**Collaboration:**
This project was one of the projects I worked on alone. Working by myself has its positive and negative parts. I don’t have to communicate with someone but I also don’t have a partner to help me in the parts I can’t manage on my own. But after finishing the project I felt very confident in Swift. 

**Program Function and Purpose:**
The program is actually like a mini calculator. You enter the price of a cone and the number of cones and it gives you the total price. But you need to enter the numbers into the code not into the program because there isn’t a place to get input. 

**Program Design and Development:**
It is just a simple multiplication program. The only difference is that there is a context about an ice cream shop and the user has to enter the numbers into the code, not into the program. The math wasn’t hard so it was an easy development.

**Identifying and Correcting Errors:**
I did not have any errors. The calculations were tricky at first because I needed to use this symbol “ * ” for multiplication while coding. Testing the program helped me confirm that the numbers and calculations worked as expected at the end.

## [Swift Burger Cafe:]()

**Collaboration:**
I worked on this project by myself and did not collaborate with anyone again. Doing it alone helped me focus better. I practiced writing code that calculates totals for different items. This project helped me feel more confident making a program including processes, on my own.

**Program Function and Purpose:**
The program calculates the total price for drinks, potatoes, and hamburgers. The number of each item and their prices are written in the code. Its purpose is to show how code can do math and display a summary of an order clearly.

**Program Design and Development:**
I made the program by giving some price values for drinks, potatoes, and hamburgers in the code. I calculated the total price and printed all the details onto the screen. The math was a little tricky because of the symbols, but it helped me practice using numbers and variables in a program.

**Identifying and Correcting Errors:**
I didn’t have any errors. The calculations were a bit tricky because of some symbols being different in code, but I checked the math and output to make sure the totals were correct. Testing the program confirmed that all numbers and calculations worked correctly.

<br>

## [Swift Calculator:]()

**Collaboration:**
I created this program with a friend. We both wrote the code but I focused on the number calculations while she helped with organizing parts of the program. Working together made it easier and quicker to finish the project. We also improved on teamwork. 

**Program Function and Purpose:**
The program is just a simple calculator that gets two numbers from the user and makes the process from the button pressed. There are buttons to add, subtract, multiply, or divide. When a button of these processes is pressed, the result appears on the bottom of the screen. It aims to let users do simple calculations quickly.

**Program Design and Development:**
I made 2 textboxes for 2 numbers and made 4 buttons for each operation. The hardest part was putting the text boxes in the right place. We both worked on the code, and the math operations. So the result was correct.

**Identifying and Correcting Errors:**
We had some trouble placing the input boxes correctly. After testing, we fixed the layout and checked the math. Once everything was in the right place, the calculator worked and gave correct results for all four operations.

## [Swift Profile:]()
**Collaboration:**
I did this project with a partner but we both did our own profiles and asked questions when we got stuck at a part. It was pretty easy, just drawing an image. With this project I learned to work with a partner on two separate projects.

**Program Function and Purpose:**
I used Swift Playground to draw my profile with codes. I used basic codes for shapes like rounded rectangles, circles, ellipses and normal rectangles. I used an image from the library for the first time which was interesting. 

**Program Design and Development:**
I created my program by arranging the shapes I drew on the screen to create my profile correctly. I put the shapes into different locations and positions. The project was not hard and it helped me practice using Swift’s shape codes. 

**Identifying and Correcting Errors:**
I did not have any major errors. I checked the placement of shapes to make sure the drawing looked correct. Testing helped me confirm that all shapes appeared where I wanted, and the final picture showed my self profile accurately.

## [Swift Clock:]()
**Collaboration:**
We worked on this project with a total of 4 people. We didn’t know anything about creating a clock from coding so we all worked together on the same thing. We all tried to make the program and everyone had a different idea which was a bit frustrating. Working with a group made things really quicker and helped all of us to understand the topic very well. 

**Program Function and Purpose:**
This program is a very simple clock application. When the screen is tapped by the user, the minute changes by +1, and the hour changes after 60 minutes. There are four buttons in total: -hour, +hour, -minute, +minute, which helps the user create the time he/she wants to see. 

**Program Design and Development:**
I worked on the clock’s basic functions with a friend. We used variables to track the time and calculated degrees for the hands. The degrees and variables were tricky, but we organized the steps carefully. The other friends added buttons for changing hours and minutes.

**Identifying and Correcting Errors:**
The variables and degree calculations were challenging at first. We tested the program to make sure the hands moved correctly and the buttons updated the time as expected. After checking and adjusting, the clock worked properly and all functions displayed the correct time.

## [Swift Ben-Ten Watch:]()
**Collaboration:**
I worked on this project with a partner. I focused on the Ben 10 style and the style change, while my friend created the gear style. Working together let us combine our skills to make the watch interactive to the user and visually interesting.

**Program Function and Purpose:**
The program is a watch that shows the time with AM/PM at the bottom. When the screen is tapped, the watch switches between the Ben 10 style and the gear style. The purpose of the program is to interest the user by adding cool visuals and a great transition between the watch styles. 

**Program Design and Development:**
I designed the Ben 10 style and added the tap logic to the button at the top right. My friend created the gear style with rotating gears and a new background. Managing the style change was actually very difficult, because it was our idea to do it with my friend but we had no idea of what to do. 

**Identifying and Correcting Errors:**
Changing the watch style was tricky and needed lots and lots of testing. We checked the tap correctly, switched styles and that the time remained visible. After many adjustments, the watch worked perfectly, and both the Ben 10 and gear styles got shown correctly.

## [Swift Binary Conversion Part 2:]()
**Collaboration:**
I made this project by myself. I did the code, design and the testing. This individual project gave me the chance to focus more on the program to work correctly. Being alone helped me to think more about my own ideas, not brainstorming about many ideas. 

**Program Function and Purpose:**
The program has a very basic and simple function. It just automatically prints out the results of the decimals between 0 and 15 as binary codes. So it is a great and simple way to show all the four digit binary codes. 

**Program Design and Development:**
I wrote the code in Swift Playgrounds Books. The design is pretty simple and basic because there isn’t anything extra than printing the binary codes. So even though it isn’t very fancy it clearly shows the answers and that was the main goal. 

**Identifying and Correcting Errors:**
At the start of the project I wasn’t perfect on converting decimals to binary codes or binary codes to decimals. So I had a small problem with the calculations but I immediately solved them and everything went smoothly. 

<br>

## [Swift Binary Conversion Part 3:]()
**Collaboration:**
Again I worked on this project alone, by myself. I focused on the button idea and started on the design. After doing this design I learned many parts of new codes that I didn’t know or understand before. So it was a good project that opened my mind. 

**Program Function and Purpose:**
The program is a conversion app that takes decimals and turns them into 4-bit binary codes. The codes are put into gray boxes and there are buttons where users can change or set the binary code or the decimal. 

**Program Design and Development:**
The design and development was pretty straightforward. I was given a mission to complete and I got working on it. Before this project I always had hard times creating functions in codes. So I made mistakes in the OVERFLOW text. But after solving it the project was working correctly. 

**Identifying and Correcting Errors:**
Like I said, the main challenge I encountered was the functions. There was a problem with the big OVERFLOW text. At first the function didn’t work at all. I looked at my previous projects to solve the problem and it worked.

## [Ice Cream Overflow:]()
**Collaboration:**
I worked completely alone in this project. I had an idea to use my earlier codes on the binary converter and add a basic ice cream to it. After my thought about this idea I quickyl started on the code and after a long time I finished the code alone. 

**Program Function and Purpose:**
This program is basically the same with the binary converter. I just added an ice cream cone and when the binary numbers overflow the ice cream gets added a scoop of ice cream. I used for each code to create the scoops. So its an ice cream that gets added a scoop after an overflow in the binary numbers. 

**Program Design and Development:**
I didn't work on the design a lot. I just put a cone from the libary of playground changed its size and added circles for the scoops. It doesn't rook a lot realistic but the function works correctly. The desing on the lower part is the same as my previous project on binary code converting. 

**Identifying and Correcting Errors:**
While working on the code I really had a hard time on the for each part because I had only used it once before and didn't understand what it really did. After solving this error I didn'T have any major problems and finished the code correctly.
