# Identifying and Correcting Errors Quiz (FRQs): 
This quiz was basically a practice for the understanding of the inputs and outputs of a program. We were asked to name the inputs and outputs of our clock program that we did for another assignment. I quickly wrote the inputs which were the taps of the screen and the switch button being pressed or not. For the outputs I wrote minute and hour hand changing and the style of the watch changing.

# PQ 2: 
I answered some more questions about the inputs and outputs, but this time there were also questions about the purpose and the variables of the program. This quiz was not harder than the last one because it was my program afterall. So I knew exactly what I should write.

# Program Functions and Purpose Quiz (FRQs):
In this quiz I answered more questions about the inputs, outputs, variables functions etc. of my watch program then created a video that explained everything I wrote about visually. I showed that when I pressed the screen the minute and hour hand would change and showed the other watch style by pressing the switch button.

# PT Test 1:
This quiz was the first quiz that had questions about programming. I answered questions about codes, collaboration and straight logic questions. I don’t think it was hard. Only the code parts were a little tricky because I don’t have any coding experience.

# Quiz 2.2:
This quiz was about the compression of files. This was something we learned in class and practiced in homeworks. Even though the topic wasn’t hard, the questions in the quiz were hard to understand. They were about very specific conditions which I had a hard time understanding.

# Quiz 2.3:
This quiz was about extracting information from data. The topic was mainly about memorising some terms and understanding the logic between data and information. I didn’t work for this quiz and so it was hard for me to do it. Even though I didn’t know it I used the information I had before and my logic to complete this quiz the best way I could.
