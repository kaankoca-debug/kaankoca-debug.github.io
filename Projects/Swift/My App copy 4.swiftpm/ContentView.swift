            //By using VStack I stack all the texts I wrote beneath vertically. With the spacing being 20 pixels every text has a 20 pixel space between them. I wrote my favorite emoji, number and color with half text and half variables. I used text to make it look like normal sentences and I wrote the variable names in the format of \() like \(favoriteNumber). The slash and paranthesis keep the text different from the variables and so my variables and texts unite to create 3 sentences.
